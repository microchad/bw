# Border Crossing

The creation of Bitcoin, and Improvement Proposals such as BIP39, have transformed our ability to store and transport value over space and time. However, in the case of people who struggle to maintain their property rights in the physical domain, or who move around a lot, paper or even steel backups can present storage and transportation challenges.

According to the UN Refugee Agency UNHCR, by mid-2021, 84 million people had been forcibly displaced worldwide. And according to Nomad Embassy, around 24 million Americans live or aspire to live as Digital Nomads currently, representing ~6.5% of the US population. For a large percentage of people who constantly move from one place of residence to another - whether by their own choice or not - transporting private property and wealth across borders represents a challenge.

This is the challenge that Border Wallets was born to solve.

By making the process of creating and memorising secure Bitcoin Wallets more simple and robust, people and families can now carry their wealth in their heads using a combination of attack-tolerant Entropy Grids or Deterministic Recovery Phrases and memorable patterns that only they know. Contrast this with the problems and risks presented with any one individual carrying a written seedphrase backup and it should become reasonably clear that the protections offered by Entropy Grids and Border Wallets give a higher degree of transportability, security and recovery assuredness.
