# Encryption

NB: encryption is in alpha testing currently.

The Entropy Grid Generator provides users with the ability to encrypt, and then decrypt, their entropy grids inside the tool.

As with the Deterministic Grids, this feature is designed for particular groups of users who will find value in it. For example, users who plan
to store their entropy grids in digital format and desire an additional level of security protection.

## Encrypting files

To encrypt your Entropy Grid, you need to create and remember a security passphrase and then drag + drop your Entropy Grid into the box.

To decrypt your Entropy Grid, you perform exactly the same step - but instead of loading your Entropy Grid into the box, you load your encrypted version of your Entropy Grid. After a short time, your Entropy Grid will be decrytped and available for use.
