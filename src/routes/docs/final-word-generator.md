# Final Word (Checksum) Calculator

The EGG includes a feature for calculating the Final (checksum) Word.

Scroll to the Final Word tab in the tool, and enter each of the four (or three) letter seed words in the correct order into the tool. Make sure you check each word carefully! By the time you reach the 24th word, the EGG has automatically calculated and populated this field for you.

<blockquote>The EGG will automatically suggest the longer version of the word, where applicable, as your enter the first four letters of it. **Select this longer word before moving to the next field**</blockquote>

By the time we reach the 24th entry, the final (checksum) word that is calculated for us - in this case, 'pair'. In addition to my pattern, I need to memorise this word.

### Final Word 'Number'

In order to help make the memorisation of the final word even easier, the EGG includes a unique Final Word Number feature. This means that instead of needing to remember the word 'pair', I can just remember the number 5. I could even write this number down on my Entropy Grid - since on its own, it is meaningless and provides no clues about my final word without the other words.

Users can, if necessary, use the scroll button at the end of the Final Word Number field to change the number to something more meaningful to them, but this also changes the final word itself. Therefore if you do change the number, the new checksum shown must be used to set-up your Border Wallet. We don't advise users change the number (since it too is generated with entropy by the tool), but you can do if you want to.
