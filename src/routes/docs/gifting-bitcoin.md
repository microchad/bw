# Gifting Bitcoin

For people looking for a simple and secure way to help family members or friends set-up a fault-tolerant (noob-safe) wallet, the Entropy Grid Generator provides a useful solution.

By generating an Entropy Grid specifically for the purpose of kick-starting someone's sat stacking journey, you can use that grid (and our Final Word calculation feature) to create a secure wallet which you give to that person but also keep a **backup** of it should they ever need it.

For example, let's say you want to set-up a young neice or newphew of yours with their own Bitcoin wallet. By using an Entropy Grid, you can give them a wallet seed phrase that you have generated securely, which you then retain a copy of - including the wallet pattern/cell co-ordinates and checksum - should they ever ask you for a backup. Let's face it, noobs often make mistakes and losing bitcoin is a harrowing experience which some people never fully recover from.

Of course, retaining a backup of someone's seedphrase for them does make you a trusted 3rd party, and so whether you do so is entirely your choice. But it seems to us like Entropy Grids could be used as a very cool way of helping noobs take their first steps into self-sovereignty with a little safety rail to help them - you.
