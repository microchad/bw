# Gotchas

> Minimise potential attack vectors when creating and storing your Entropy Grid(s).

> When creating your Pattern, make sure you are in a secure environment with no cameras (e.g. cell phones, CCTV), onlookers, etc.

> Don't make a pattern that is ridiculously easy - e.g. a straight line down from A1 to A23. Think defensively.

> Don't leave your Entropy Grid in the same location as an copies of your Pattern (we recommend destroying your pattern after memorising it, or treating it with the same high degree of security that you would a full copy of your seed phrase).

> Do not leave drafts of any patterns you may draw unattended or lying around.

> If you haven't checked that your backups work, you don't have any backups. Don't trust, verify!
