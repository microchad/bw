# Gridception

Inspired by Christopher Nolan's film Inception (2010), 'gridception' is the name @SuperPhatArrow gave to the idea of using seed words in one Entropy Grid to create another Entropy Grid - and then doing the same again, and again, and again, if so desired - via our Determininstic Grid and Grid Regeneration features.

By using one pattern or more across multiple Entropy Grids, gridception provides users with the ability to hide their master Border Wallet within an unlimited number of Entropy Grid layers. Each time to you do this - particularly if you apply your own randomness or idiosyncracies to the mix - you compound the difficulty for any would-be attackers.
