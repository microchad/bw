## A new way to quickly memorise and easily recall Bitcoin seed words

Border Wallets solve a problem faced by many Bitcoiners; how to quickly, easily, securely and reliably memorise 12 or 24 (or more) seed words. The idea draws on a concept known as the Picture Superiority Effect, and employs the use of user-generated patterns applied to a randomised map of (BIP-39 compliant) seed words - offline, in a secure, air-gapped setting.

Primarily, the project is aimed at people who:

- have difficulty/concerns with securely caching physical seed backups (evil maid attack)
- want to memorise their seed words but struggle to do so
- want to carry their seed words with them at all times
- have limited access to trusted 3rd parties
- live in areas of conflict, warzones, etc.
- regularly travel or move around
- have no permanent fixed abode.

In practice, though, _it can be used by anybody_ who wants to more easily and more reliably commit their Bitcoin seed words to memory.

### Applications

For Bitcoin, Border Wallets and Entropy Grids offer new applications and solutions for Bitcoin cold storage and transportation, legacy ownership transfers, gifting, 3rd-party custody assistance and, most obviously, border crossings. Beyond Bitcoin, we envisage the idea being applicable to other decentralised protocols where seed words are used for user account backup, e.g. Nostr and similar Web5 & DID-type systems.

> BorderWallets.com is currently in limited beta release. Our Entropy Grid Generator is available on our GH repo for Bitcoiners to start testing. We welcome feedback for improving it and ideas for making it more accessible to more people.
