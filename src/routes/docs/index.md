**A new way to quickly memorise and easily recall Bitcoin seed words.**

Bitcoin Border Wallets primarily solves one problem faced by many Bitcoiners; how to quickly, easily, securely and reliably memorise 12 or 24 (or more) seed words. The idea draws on a concept known as the Picture Superiority Effect, and employs the use of user-generated patterns applied to a randomised map of BIP-39 compliant words - offline, in a secure, air-gapped setting using a Fisher-Yates Shuffle algorithm.

Secondarily, Border Wallets can also be used as a simple but effective method for handling Bitcoin legacy ownership transfers.

Border Wallets are primarily aimed at people who:

- may have difficulty securely caching physical seed backups
- want to carry their seed words with them at all times
- have limited access to trusted 3rd parties
- live in areas of conflict, warzones, etc.
- regularly travel.

In practice, though, _it can be used by anybody_ who wants to more easily and more reliably commit their Bitcoin seed words to memory.

> BorderWallets.com is currently in alpha release. Our Entropy Grid Generator is available on our GH repo for Bitcoiners to start testing. We welcome feedback for improving it and ideas for making it more accessible to more people.

The best kind of Bitcoin wallet is one that's easy for the user to access and hard to lose, but hard for an attacker to access and easy to miss.

## Overview

There will soon be a video here providing a walk-through of the problem we are trying to solve and the principles behind Border Wallets.

## About

Let's take a look at the problems we are trying to solve, the solution we have created, and some of The Science™️ behind why patterns beat words when it comes to memorisation and recall.
