# Regenerating Entropy Grids

## Deterministic grid regeneration

The Entropy Grid Generator provides the option - when creating your Entropy Grid - to choose Deterministic entropy. By using 128-bits of entropy in the creation of these grids (the same level used when generating 12-word Bitcoin seed backups with 128 dice rolls) we have the ability to simultaneously generate 12 words Regeneration Phrases which allow users to write down a backup to their Entropy Grid in plain text. These Regeneration Phrases are automatically added to the bottom of Deterministic Entropy Grids during generation.

NB: Maximum Entropy Grids use 19580-bits of entropy. It is not possible to offer regenerative recovery phrases with this level of randomness.

The provision of Recovery Phrase may at first glance seem counter-intuitive to the concept of Border Wallets - afterall, we are giving users the ability to memorise seed words, not find new ways of writing new ones down!
  
However, some users may find value in having the option to make hand-written or digital copies of regeneration words in some circumstances - for example, if you decide to lodge a copy of an Entropy Grid with a 3rd party for safe-keeping, e.g. a sibling, parent, child, etc. then giving them a 12 word Recovery Phrase (which looks like a Bitcoin seed word backup, but is not one) instead of a full copy of your Entropy Grid adds an additional level of security. 12 words which look like a Bitcoin seed phrase but don't act like one is potentially a very useful decoy.
  
Having 12 words as a representation for an Entropy Grid instead of a PDF file may also open up more options for users to store the keys to their grids.

Let's test it.

These are the top 5 rows x 16 columns generated by the following Recovery Phrase:

Let's walk through how we regenerate it using the EGG's Regenerate feature.

## Using the Regenerate feature

> 1. Open borderwallets.html. Navigate to the "Regenerate" tab.
  
![reg-test](/regen-test-1.png)
<caption>You are given a field to enter a Recovery Phrase, and select the type of grid that it is expected to generat.</caption>

Here you will see a field presented for you to enter a Recovery Phrase. Go ahead and input the 12-word Recovery Phrase above or your own one.

![reg-test](/regen-test.png)
<caption>Your grid will be regenerated and placed in your dowwnloads folder. In the case above, the same words in the top 5 rows that we saw earlier and regenerated</caption>

Check your downloads. That's it. You have regenerated a Deterministic Entropy Grid.

Now let's look at Encryption.
