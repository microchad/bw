# Regenerating Entropy Grids

## Deterministic grid regeneration

The Entropy Grid Generator provides the option - when creating your Entropy Grid - to choose Deterministic entropy. By using 128-bits of entropy in the creation of these grids (the same level used when generating 12-word Bitcoin seed backups with 128 dice rolls) we have the ability to simultaneously generate 12 words Regeneration Phrases which allow users to write down a backup to their Entropy Grid in plain text. These Regeneration Phrases are automatically added to the bottom of Deterministic Entropy Grids during generation.

The provision of Regeneration Phrase may at first glance seem counter-intuitive to the concept of Border Wallets - afterall, we are giving users the ability to memorise seed words, not find new ways of writing new ones down!
  
However, some users may find value in having the option to make hand-written or digital copies of regeneration words in some circumstances - for example, if you decide to lodge a copy of an Entropy Grid with a 3rd party for safe-keeping, e.g. a sibling, parent, child, etc. then giving them 12 random words (which look like a Bitcoin seed word backup, but aren't one) instead of a full copy of your Entropy Grid adds an additional level of security.
  
Having 12 words as a representation for an Entropy Grid instead of a PDF file may also open up more opportunities for users to store the keys to their grids.

Let's walk through how we regenerate is using our EGG's Regenerate feature.
