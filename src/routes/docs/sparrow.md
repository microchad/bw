DRAFT - WORK IN PROGRESS

# Sparrow Wallet Integration

Sparrow Wallet has now implemented Border Wallets natively in its world-class desktop application.

If you want the best experience for creating, saving, regenerating and using Border Wallets and Entropy Grids, this is our recommended approach.

Massive thanks to Craig Raw for his work on this.
