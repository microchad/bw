# The Problem

## The 12/24 seed words that provide wallet back-up and recovery capability can be difficult to memorise and recall â€“ especially over time, or in stressful situations.

Since the introduction of BIP39 seed words, Bitcoiners have had the option to memorise the necessary information to recover Bitcoin funds stored on-chain. Eventhough memorising 12 words is easier than 24, most people tend to prefer using 24 words and most wallet management solution providers typically recommend this too. Memorising - and reliably remembering - 24 unrelated words isn't that easy, though, which means that most people create and store physical backups of those words instead of committing them to memory.

Whilst this well-established approach is fine for those who are confident in their physical security situation, it is a challenge for people living in shared or higher-risk or more fluid accommodation or settings. For example, people with no fixed abode, who travel, who live in areas of conflict or war zones, e.g. Yemen, Syria, or those living in other settings where physical storage of physical seed words may be subject to security, loss, damage and confiscation risks.

A recent example of how someone who lives in a shared property had their Bitcoin seed words taken.

Some Numbers

According to the UN Refugee Agency [UNHCR](https://www.example.com](https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/), 84 million people had been forcibly displaced worldwide. A large number of these people would have had to flee their homes with little more than the clothes on their backs and what personal belongings they could carry. The transportation of any wealth along with personal belongings may have been an impossible challenge.

According to 
, nearly 5 million Americans identify as Digital Nomads and another 17 million aspire for this lifestyle. That's 1.5% - 6.5% of the US population who want to live a roving lifestyle.
An  35% of Americans rent their accommodation, and house-sharing is on the rise as home-ownership collapses (

     amongst younger generations).

The creation of Bitcoin, and Improvement Proposals such as BIP39, have transformed our ability to store and transport value over space and time. However, in the case of people who struggle to maintain their property rights in the physical domain, or who move around a lot, paper or even steel backups can present storage and transportation challenges.
So - instead of needing to carry full paper seed word backups in their pockets - what if people they could carry them more easily, and reliably, in their heads?
