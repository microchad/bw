# Third Parties
### Not your pattern, not your coins

One of the benefits of Bitcoin over physical bearer assets like gold is that multiple copies of seedphrases can be created and used as fault-tolerant backups.

As a result, it is not uncommon for Bitcoiners to lodge copies of their Bitcoin wallet backups with trusted family members or 3rd-parties. Whilst having people and entities who you can truly rely on is a blessing, it does come with a variety of risks - risks which may not, in many cases, be fully understandable by those 3rd-parties themselves.

For example:

- Does your trusted 3rd-party have the same degree of appreciation for Bitcoin being a full bearer asset that you do?
- Do they understand that your private keys, once compromised, can be spent before they even realise they have been compromised?
- Do they have the same high-standards of security in place that you do for your own copy of your private keys?
- Will they be able to remember where they keep your wallet backups if any when you ask them to recover it?
- How seriously do they take their home security, and the security of your private keys? Is it the same as your own protections?
- What happens if they are burgled? What if they have a fire? What if they accidentally toss your seedphrase out in the garbage? What if they move home?
- What happens if they are compromised or ordered to disclose your keys as part of a state-sanctioned attack on individual rights?

And, finally, how certain can you be that your relationship will never sour, never endure troughs as well as peaks, and that your wallet will be 100% safe, even if your relationship dynamics change? What if something that you don't expect to happen to your relationship happens? What happens to they struggle to pay the bills but can't help notice that Bitcoin's number go up? Are you absolutely certain that in all cases, your seedphrase will not be at risk?

Border Wallets provide users with the option to leave backups to your Entropy Grids with family members or other trusted 3rd-parties without entrusting them with all of the parts of your Bitcoin treasure map.

Considering the risks presented above, how much more securely might you sleep if you gave those parties an Entropy Grid or an Entropy Grid Recovery Phrase (see our Deterministic Grid feature) which they - and potentially other 3rd-parties - could be entrusted with whilst limiting their exposure to risks of loss, theft or fire?

Entropy Grids provide a vital element of a Border Wallet solution. The Checksum and Pattern provide the other two. Together, these factors can be combined to provide a variety of ways to strengthen your backup capabilities and to increase the potential backup options available to you, whilst ensuring that a sufficiently high-level of difficulty is present for any potential attackers.
