Introducing a new way to quickly and reliably memorise Bitcoin seed phrases.

(Video explainer placeholder)

**TLDR:**

Memorising Bitcoin seed phrases (typically between 12 and 24 randomised words) can be difficult. By exploiting a phenomenon known as the Picture Superiority Effect, we have devised a way make it significantly easier to do this - using user-generated patterns.

To assist with this process and make it robust and secure, we have created a tool (the Entropy Grid Generator - or EGG) that randomises all 2048 Bitcoin BIP39 seed words and presents them back to users as unique, randomised matrices; we call these 'Entropy Grids'.

When users generate their Entropy Grid, they apply their own choice of pattern(s) to them, therein unlocking each applicable seed word to create uniquely memorable wallets; we call these 'Border Wallets'.

For more information on how we do this, to access our Entropy Grid Generator (EGG), and for instructions on how to create your own Border Wallet, read our [Documentation](/docs) section in detail.
